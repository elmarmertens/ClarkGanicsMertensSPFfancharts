# REPLICATION FILES

WORK IN PROGRESS 

please come back by Nov 28 2022

## “Constructing Fan Charts from the Ragged Edge of SPF Forecasts“ and “What Is the Predictive Value of SPF Point and Density Forecasts?“

This readme file describes the set of replication files (“the replication set“) for two papers:

1. “Constructing Fan Charts from the Ragged Edge of SPF Forecasts“ (henceforth the FanCharts paper)

2. “What Is the Predictive Value of SPF Point and Density Forecasts?“ (henceforth the EntropicTilting paper)  

The replication set contains code as well as all of our input data in raw form as obtained from their original sources described further below. The data and code used by both papers overlap. Specifically, the EntropicTilting paper requires first estimating some of the models discussed in the FanCharts paper.
